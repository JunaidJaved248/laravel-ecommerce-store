#### **Bug Reporting**
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues.](https://github.com/JunaidJaved248/laravel-ecommerce-store/issues)
* If you're unable to find an open issue that relates to your problem, [open a new one.](https://github.com/JunaidJaved248/laravel-ecommerce-store/issues/new) Please be sure to follow the issue template as much as possible.

#### **Did you fix a bug?**

* To provide a code contribution for an issue you will need to set up your own fork of the Laravel Ecommerce Store repository, make your code changes, commit the changes and make a Pull Request to the `developed` branch on the Laravel Ecommerce Store repository. 
* Separate each fix into a new branch in your repository and name it with the issue ID e.g. bugfix_3062 or issue-1234.
* After you have made your commits and pushed them up to your forked repository you then create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to be reviewed and merged into the Laravel Ecommerce Store repository. Make a new Pull Request for each issue you fix.    **do not combine multiple bugfixes into one Pull Request**.
* Ensure that you send your Pull Request to the `developed`.


#### **Did you create a new feature or enhancement?**

* Changes that can be considered a new feature or enhancement should be made to the `developed` branch.
* To contribute a feature you must create a fork of Laravel Ecommerce Store and set up your git and development environment.
  Once done, create a new branch from **developed** and name it relevant to the feature's purpose.
  Make sure your commit messages are relevant and descriptive. When ready to submit for review, make a Pull Request detailing your feature's functionality.
  Ensure that your Pull Requests base fork is **JunaidJaved248/laravel-ecommerce-store**, the base branch is **developed**, the head fork is your repository, and the base branch is your feature branch.
* Add any new PHPUnit tests to the new feature branch if required.

## Issue and Pull Request Labels

* This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests across the repositories.
